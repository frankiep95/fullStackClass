Hello!

My name is Frankie,

I have always been extreemly interested in technology and how things works. I have dabbled in many diffrent types of technology. i have been an Electronics Technician for
over 10 years. I have self learned the c language and mainly use it for programming embedded avr microcontrollers. i am currently working as an Electronics Engineer building 
Electro-Mechanical camera stabilization systems for the film industry. I am a Veteran of the US Navy where i was an avionics and weapons systems technician for FA-18's. I have
an in-depth knowledge of analog and digital electronics theory and circuit design. I want to become more comfortable with higher level programming languages such as java and python.
my goal is to be able to design embedded systems from the PCB's to the user application.
